Description: Generates pseudo-random vectors that follow an arbitrary von Mises-Fisher 
  distribution on a sphere. This method is fast and efficient when generating a large number of 
  pseudo-random vectors. Functions to generate random variates and compute density 
  for the distribution of an inner product between von Mises-Fisher random vector and 
  its mean direction are also provided.
